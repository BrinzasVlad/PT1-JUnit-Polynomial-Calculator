This was a project for my 2nd year, 2nd semester subject "Programming techniques".

The given task was to write an application that can process polynomial numbers and operations on them such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

The exact grading criteria can be found in the _HW1_Grading.pdf_ file (which was handed to us in Romanian by mistake, although we are studying in English).

A more detailed description of the project, the employed classes, design patterns used, use-cases covered, assumptions made and so on can be found in the _PT Documentation.pdf_ file.
